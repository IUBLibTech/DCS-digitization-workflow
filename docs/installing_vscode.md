# Installing Visual Studio Code

## Windows 11

### Install VSCode software

* Go to the Microsoft Store.  On my default Windows install it's on the bottom 
bar, but it may not be on standard build machines.
* Enter `code` into the search box.  "Visual Studio Code" shoudl be one of the
first results.  It's free.
* Hit the install button.
* Close the store
* Open the start menu and select "All Apps".  Find "Visual Studio Code" and
drag it to the desktop for easy access.


### Install the YAML plugin for VSCode
* Double click on the Visual Studio Code icon on the desktop.
* Click on the extensions icon on the left hand side. It looks like 4 squares 
with the upper right one floating away
* Type `yaml` in the search box.  The YAML plugin from Redhat should be the
first result, or close to it.  Clock on it and hit the install button.

At this point you should be able to use VSCode to open a project folder and edit
the yaml files with all of the schemas enabled.
